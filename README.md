## üõ†Ô∏è Installing and upgrading Countly server

Countly installation script assumes it is running on a fresh, decent Ubuntu/CentOS/RHEL Linux without any services listening on port 80 or 443 (which should also be open to incoming traffic), and takes care of every library and software required to be installed for Countly to run.

There are several ways to install Countly:

1. The following command will download and install Countly on your **Ubuntu** or **CentOS** server.

   `wget -qO- https://c.ly/install | bash`

2. For bash lovers, we provide a beautiful installation script (`bin/countly.install.sh`) in countly-server package which installs everything required to run Countly Server. For this, you need a stable release of this repository [available here](https://github.com/Countly/countly-server/releases).

3. Countly Community Edition also has Docker support - [see our official Docker repository](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/countly/countly-server/) and [installation instructions for Docker](https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/360036862332-Installing-the-Countly-Server).

If you want to upgrade Countly from a previous version, please take a look at [upgrading documentation](https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/360037443652-Upgrading-the-Countly-Server).

## üß© API, extensibility and plugins

Countly has a [well defined API](https://api.count.ly), that reads and writes data from/to the Countly backend. Countly dashboard is built using the read API, so it's possible to fetch any information you see on the dashboard using the API.

Countly is extensible using the plugin architecture. If you would like to modify any exiting feature by extending it or changing it, or if you would like to add completely new capabilities to Countly you can modify existing plugins or create new ones. We suggest [you read this document](https://support.count.ly/hc/en-us/articles/360036862392-Introduction) if you would like to start with plugin development.
